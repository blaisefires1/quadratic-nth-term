# Quadratic Nth Term Solver
#### I'm still getting the hang of Python so it's quite rudimentary. 

This piece of code will require **exactly 3 integer** inputs to function as intended.

Once you have specified all three inputs the program will then print the nth term in the standard polynomial format of ax^2^ + bx + c 
(with n in the place of x).
Afterwards you will be prompted if you would like to calculate the value of a term in the sequence, typing an integer will substitue it into the Nth term and output your desired term,
typing anyhting other than an integer will end the program.
This will continue indefinitely until you type a non-integer value.

The Quadratic Nth Term will be displayed as: a.0n^2 + b.0n + c
