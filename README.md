# Quadratic Nth Term Solver
#### I'm still getting the hang of Python so it's quite rudimentary. 

This piece of code will require **exactly 3 integer** inputs to function as intended.

Once you have specified all three inputs the program will then print the nth term in the standard polynomial format of ax^2^ + bx + c.
Afterwards you will be prompted if you would like to calculate the value of a term in the sequence, typing _'Y'_ will ask for a term you would like to calculate, 
typing _'N'_ will end the program. 
This will continue indefinitely until you type _'N'_ when prompted.

The Quadratic Nth Term will be displayed as: a.0x^2 + b.0x + c.0

I don't yet support any interface other than the Command Line nor binaries for Mac or Linux.
